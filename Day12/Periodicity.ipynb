    "### Part 2: Periodicity of the motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was NOT EASY. From the beginning I knew I had to look into the equations of motions to find some recurring pattern which simplified the dynamics. By looking at the extensive examples provided in the assignment I could tell that the motion on the various axes were decoupled and also that there were a lot of conserved quantities. In particular the sum of the components of both velocity and position of the 4 bodies on every axes were constant. In other words, if $X^i_\\alpha(t)$ are the components of the position of body at time $t$ and $V^i_\\alpha(t)$ are the ones of its velocity, it holds that:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\sum_{\\alpha = 1}^{4} X^i_\\alpha(t) = \\sum_{\\alpha = 1}^{ 4} X^i_\\alpha(0)\\\\\n",
    "    \\sum_{\\alpha = 1}^{4} V^i_\\alpha(t) = \\sum_{\\alpha = 1}^{ 4} V^i_\\alpha(0) = 0 \\hspace{0.5 cm} \\forall i = 1, 2, 3\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "I thought I could use these to simplify the dynamics, but the fact that the dynamic of one bodies depends on all the others made this seem difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "Not having any useful insight (I thought I didn't) I gave up and looked at some hint on reddit, only to find that the decoupling of the motion on the axes was in fact the right path to follow. With this new certainty, I generalized my classes to work on variable dimension by specifying it in the constructors of the objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "It then occurred to me. The decoupling essentially means that the 3 dimensional system is simply 3 copies of the same 1 dimensional system, all starting from a different initial condition. These means that if I I know the periodicity of the one dimensional system starting from the 3 initial conditions, the periodicity of the 3d one will be the ***least common multiplier between these 3 periodicities***. \n",
