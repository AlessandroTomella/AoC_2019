# AoC_2019
Repository with Python solutions to Advent of Code 2019 challenges

[Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019/about) by [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/)

Advent of Code is a series of 50 programming challenges, 2 for each day leading up to Christmas. 
This is the series of challenges put out by the author for the 2019 edition.

I used Python to solve some of them and I am currently working on the remaining ones.
All the solutions are provided in jupyter-notebooks format, and the codes are 
heavily commented to explain the reasoning behind them. All directories contain:
- 1 input file named "input.txt" provided by the text of the challenge
- 1 or 2 .ipynb files with the solutions to the 2 challenges of that day. 


Thank you Eric for the awesome work!
